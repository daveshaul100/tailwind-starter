# tailwind-starter
Basic starter for Tailwind CSS for vanilla js and JIT

Reusable Tailwind starter that is set up for Just-In-Time mode which only needs to be run once for production. This will mean that throughout the build the full Tailwind CSS file will be used as the purge is only run on build.
